    An easy-to-cook pizza as detailed by themoodyfoodie on <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/244636/cheesy-crust-skillet-pizza/" target="_blank">Allrecipes</a>!
    This recipe is entirely created on a SKILLET. That's right! And it requires no dough. A simple ONE-ongredient cheesy crust that makes for a great last-minute meal.
    This recipe yields 2 servings and only takes 10 minutes of prep time and 5 minutes to cook!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Â½ cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>5 cherry tomatoes, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons torn fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>4 small fresh mozzarella balls (bocconcini), thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a 10-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese evenly into hot skillet; cook until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Arrange tomato slices, basil leaves, and fresh mozzarella slices on the melted cheese, leaving space for a "crust" to form; cook until top is bubbling and edges are browned, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove skillet from heat and loosen pizza with a spatula. Gently slice pizza onto a cutting board; cool for 1 minute before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
