# odin-recipes
This project is a part of The Odin Project (www.theodinproject.com). I will be going through the "Recipes" project in the Foundations Course. This involves the development of a basic recipe website to enhance my HTML knowledge.

Check out the recipe site by following the index.html link. Click through and find a simple recipe to make at home yourself!
